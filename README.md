# Wireframe
This a project designed to help me learn and practice building a w\Wireframe with HTML and CSS.

I'm glad I went back to this assignment. It was still challenging but I did quite a bit with out looking at the solution. I plan to review it and try it again w/o looking at the solution. Practice makes perfect. 

Code daily. Commit often.
